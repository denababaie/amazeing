## About The Project
Had to create a simple **maze** using JS.

[more detailed instructions](https://github.com/becodeorg/bxl-hopper-1-25/tree/master/The%20Hill/projects/2.amazeing)

### Built With
This project was built using JS, HTML and CSS

### How it went
Tried some things that didn't work out such as adding a new level to the game.
I also lost quite some time trying to figure out how I could make an image pop when being on a certain tile.

### Project
